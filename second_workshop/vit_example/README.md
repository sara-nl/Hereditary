# Federated finetuning of a ViT

This example shows how to use Flower's Simulation Engine to federate the finetuning of a Vision Transformer ([ViT-Base-16](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/models/generated/torchvision.models.vit_b_16.html#torchvision.models.vit_b_16)) that has been pretrained on ImageNet. To keep things simple we'll be finetuning it to [Oxford Flower-102](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html) datasset, creating 20 partitions using [Flower Datasets](https://flower.ai/docs/datasets/). We'll be finetuning just the exit `head` of the ViT, this means that the training is not that costly and each client requires just ~1GB of VRAM (for a batch size of 32 images).

## Running the example

If you haven't cloned the Flower repository already you might want to clone code example and discard the rest. We prepared a single-line command that you can copy into your shell which will checkout the example for you:

```shell
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/adap/flower.git && mv flower/examples/vit-finetune . && rm -rf flower && cd vit-finetune
```

This will create a new directory called `vit-finetune` containing the following files:

```
-- README.md         <- Your're reading this right now
-- main.py           <- Main file that launches the simulation
-- client.py         <- Contains Flower client code and ClientApp
-- server.py         <- Contains Flower server code and ServerApp
-- model.py          <- Defines model and train/eval functions
-- dataset.py        <- Downloads, partitions and processes dataset
-- pyproject.toml    <- Example dependencies, installable using Poetry
-- requirements.txt  <- Example dependencies, installable using pip
```

### Installing Dependencies

Project dependencies (such as `torch` and `flwr`) are defined in `pyproject.toml` and `requirements.txt`. We recommend [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) to install those dependencies and manage your virtual environment ([Poetry installation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)) or [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/development/), but feel free to use a different way of installing dependencies and managing virtual environments if you have other preferences.

#### Poetry

```shell
poetry install
poetry shell
```

#### pip

With an activated environemnt, install the dependencies for this example:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run with `start_simulation()`

Running the example is quite straightforward. You can control the number of rounds `--num-rounds` (which defaults to 20).

```bash
python main.py
```

![](_static/central_evaluation.png)

Running the example as-is on an RTX 3090Ti should take ~15s/round running 5 clients in parallel (plus the _global model_ during centralized evaluation stages) in a single GPU. Note that more clients could fit in VRAM, but since the GPU utilization is high (99%-100%) we are probably better off not doing that (at least in this case).

You can adjust the `client_resources` passed to `start_simulation()` so more/less clients run at the same time in the GPU. Take a look at the [Documentation](https://flower.ai/docs/framework/how-to-run-simulations.html) for more details on how you can customise your simulation.
